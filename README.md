# Twin-Rotor-Multi-Input-Multi-Output-Control-System
This project implements Twin Rotor MIMO System stabilization using a composite control approach: Sliding Mode Control (SMC) and State Feedback Control. The system includes rotary encoders, a brushless DC motor, and a Raspberry Pi 4. It minimizes chattering with a saturation function, ensuring fast, stable performance.
